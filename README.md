# laser_tag_robot_tank

Arduino code to create a laser-shooting robotic tank.

## Software Requirements

### Arduino
Of course, you need the Arduino software. Make sure you have a recent version. At last update, the version I was using to develop was 1.8.12.

### Library requirements:
You can install these via the Arduino library manager.

 - PinChangeInterrupt (https://github.com/NicoHood/PinChangeInterrupt)
 - Arduino-IRremote (https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote) The author recommends to uninstall the Robot-IRremote library.
 - PVision (https://github.com/omwah/PVision)

### Optional
 - Arduino-Makefile (https://github.com/sudar/Arduino-Makefile) I hate the Arduino IDE. I much prefer using vim to edit and Make to build/upload to the board.
