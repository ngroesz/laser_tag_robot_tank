During development, I often ended up discovering conflicts as I assembled components. Libraries would 
use pins I did not expect them to use, etc. 

I created these sketches to isolate issues. Also to test a single hardware component.

The simple_* sketches generally use the bare-minimum to get a tank component working, along with printing
some debug info.
